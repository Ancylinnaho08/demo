I have an younger sibling , he is in grade 12th.
i love cooking and baking 
After 4years of my collge studies am planning to explore the computer feild through my experience from college.
As am from the biology stream , kinda worried about my coding skills and computer knowledge ,if prpoer guidance is provided i can excel in codings and stuffs.
Myself, my mom and my brother we stay in coimbatore , my father he lives in abroad and once in a year he comes to India for vacation.
My mom she is an awesome speaker,in which i get inspired by her talks and it motivates me.
My brother he is an guitarist and pretty much intrested in music.
He creates songs on his own also develops diffrent sorts of music.
I dont have any specific rolemodel, but am kinda inspired by the story writer Rick Riordan because of his writing and thinking skills of how a book should be intresting.
I love reading comics.
Specifically there is this book called PERCY JACKSON and it has nearly 15 books. I just read it within an month.
I play games do i just dont play it i also think of how it is been created and designed ,so thats how it made me to bring up the courage on building up or developing games on my own.
